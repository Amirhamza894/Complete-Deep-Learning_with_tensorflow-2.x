# Complete-Deep-Learning_with_tensorflow-2.x
this repsository contain deep learning jupyter notebooks with tensorflow 2.x and keras 2.x. i have done many things like deep learning, Artificial neural network (ANN), Convolutional neural network (CNN), Reinforcement neural network (RNN), hyperparameter tuning, tensorflow lite conversion and many more.


## <mark>`Complete Deep-Learning/transfer-learning and Deep Neural Network with keras and tensorflow`</mark>
#### 1. Introduction to tensorflow
> the first directory in my repository is intorduction to tensorflow, in this directory i have completed some of the basic introduction to tensorflow. difference between tensorflow 1.x and tensorflow 2.x
and a pdf file with detail explination and 2 jupyter notebooks.
**Notebooks**
* 1. tensorflow 1.x.ipynb
* 2. tensorflow 2.x.ipynb

**Notes**
* 10 tensorflow Advantages.pdf
#### 2. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
> the second directory in my repo is Artificial neural network, in this directory i have explained each and every thing about ANN in jupyter notebook with markdown and code cells.
two jupyter notebooks with Churn_modeling.csv dataset. which i pick from kaggle

**Dataset**
* Churn_modeling

**Notebooks**
* ANN.ipynb
* Building_an_artificial_neural_network.ipynb

#### 3. Hyperparameter-tuning-for-ANN
> the third directory in my repo is Hyperparameter tuning for ANN for deep neural network in kerastuner and sklearn.
**Datasets**
* Churn_modeling.csv
* Real_Combine.csv

**Notebooks**
* 1. keras-tuner-hyperparameter-tuning
* 2. hyperparameter-tuning with keras-tuner
